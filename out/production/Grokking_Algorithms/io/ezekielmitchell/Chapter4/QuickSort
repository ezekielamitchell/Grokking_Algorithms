# Quicksort
An algorithm that sorts a list by first choosing a pivot and then rearranging the indexes accordingly

Its speed depends on the pivot chosen

A type of divide and conquer (D&C) algorithm that is a sorting algorithm

Much faster than selection sort

# Divide and Conquer
With every recursion call, I must reduce my problem

# Complexity
O(n^2) -- worst case
O(n*Log_n) -- average case
