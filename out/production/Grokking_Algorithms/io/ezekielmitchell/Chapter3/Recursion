# Pseudocode
A high-level description of the problem I am trying to solve, in code.

# Recursion
The act of a function calling itself until the task is completed or the search for item is found

When running a recursive function, I must tell the function when to stop calling itself

There are two parts to a recursive function:
1. Recursive case: when the function calls itself
2. Base case: when the function stops calling itself

# Call Stack
Computers internally use the call stack

When I call a function from another, the calling function is paused in a partially completed state --
all of the values of variables for that function are still stored in memory

WARNING: using stacks is convenient but saving too much info will take up a lot of computer memory
FIX: change to a loop or use tail recursion (advanced recursion)
