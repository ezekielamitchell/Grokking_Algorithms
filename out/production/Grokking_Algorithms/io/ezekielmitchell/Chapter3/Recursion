# Pseudocode
A high-level description of the problem I am trying to solve, in code.

# Recursion
The act of a function calling itself until the task is completed or the search for item is found

When running a recursive function, I must tell the function when to stop calling itself

There are two parts to a recursive function:
1. Recursive case: when the function calls itself
2. Base case: when the function stops calling itself

# Call Stack
Computers internally use the call stack
